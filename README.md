# Campus-Recruitment-System
This project is my first take on different features offered in javaSwing and OOPS concepts of java while learning them in my third semester!!

This project is basically a campus recruitment system ie in this you give your qualifications and two skills you have and it will check the database and suggest a job you are eligible to apply for and then store your information that it takes and store in a database!!
The first page opens with a login page (User ID = student and password = password) which has a case sensitive password.
After logging you fill in your information and using that it suggests various jobs you are capable for applying, while storing the same information.

Some of the features used  by me are:
java.awt.*;
javax.swing.*;
java.awt.event.ActionListener;
java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
javax.swing.border.Border;
java.sql.*;
java.awt.event.ItemListener;
java.awt.event.ItemEvent;

Note: While running the code, loading of pictures might cause some problems as the destination source of it might need to be changed.

It's my first project undertaken and is a little small and not that great but as an upcoming coder this was a great opportunity to learn various skills of java and OOPS concept!!
